## Introduction

<p>
Access to healthcare services is a fundamental right of every human being. It is essential for individuals and communities to have access to quality healthcare services to maintain good health and wellbeing. However, in many parts of the world, including Ghana, access to healthcare services is limited, 
especially in rural areas. This can result in increased morbidity and mortality rates, as well as disparities in health outcomes between urban and rural populations.
</p>
<p>This assessment provides valuable insights into the accessibility and availability of healthcare services in Ho, Ghana, and highlights areas that 
require attention to meet the WHO standards and SDG goals.
